### Intro

VSKeys is a 3D Piano player demo and visualizer. This project uses three.js, Tone.js, and MIDI.js to anaylyze music data and visualize it into 3D space. This project features two visualizers. The first is a Tonnetz, which is a tool created by Leonhard Euler to show harmonic relationships between notes. Euler was fascinated by the mathematics behind music theory and inspired us to use the math behind harmony to create our own harmony visualizer we call "Harmony Spirograph". Both tools are responsive to live keyboard input or can play songs at the bottom of the settings bar via MIDI input and tone.js.
